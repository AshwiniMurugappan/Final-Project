## 📈 Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions face significant financial risks due to loan defaults. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to default on their loans is crucial for effective risk management.
This project addresses the challenge of developing a robust and reliable system that can predict the probability of loan default based on historical customer data. By building such a system, we aim to provide a valuable tool for banks to make more informed lending decisions, mitigate potential losses, and optimize their risk management strategies.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The project involves two datasets: **loan_data** and **data_dictionary**. 

- The **loan_data Dataset** comprises 14,13,701 entries, each detailing an individual client loan details. This includes information such as `NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE_x`, `CODE_GENDER`, `FLAG_OWN_CAR`, `CNT_CHILDREN`, `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` and `AMT_CREDIT_x`(pricing details), as well as `TARGET` (which needs to be predicted). This dataset offers a thorough view of loan details, covering client details and loan details. 

- The **data_dictionary Dataset** consists of 161 entries that describe the columns of the loan_data. This dataset provides detailed insights into the composition of each column and the amount of importance required.
